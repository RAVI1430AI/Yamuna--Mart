IYamuna Mart: A Shopping App Made with HTML & CSS 
Conceptualizing: I sketched out the app's layout, defining key sections like product categories, search bar, and shopping cart.
Building the Foundation: I started with basic HTML structure, creating sections and divs for different app elements.
Adding Style: I used CSS to style the app, defining colors, fonts, and layouts for a visually appealing experience.
Product Showcase: I created individual product cards using HTML and CSS, highlighting details like images and descriptions.
Navigation Flow: I implemented hyperlinks in the HTML and CSS to allow users to navigate between different app sections.
Interactive Elements: I added basic interactions like hover effects and buttons using CSS, making the app feel more engaging.
Responsive Design: I adapted the app's layout to different screen sizes using CSS media queries, ensuring a smooth experience on various devices.
Testing and Refinement: I rigorously tested the app on different browsers, making adjustments to fix any bugs or improve usability.
Polishing Details: I added finishing touches like icons and animations using CSS, enhancing the app's overall look and feel.
Voila! Yamuna Mart is born: A functional shopping app, built from scratch using the power of HTML and CSS!
